### 4. Benefits of Custom Action URLs

- **Prevents Spam**: Custom domain emails are less likely to be marked as spam
- **Professional Appearance**: Users see your domain instead of Firebase's
- **Better User Experience**: Seamless integration with your app
- **Trust Building**: Users trust emails from your domain more than generic ones
- **Custom UI**: You control the verification/reset experience

### 5. How It Works

1. User registers/requests password reset
2. Firebase sends email with your custom action URL
3. User clicks link in email
4. Your custom EmailActionHandler component processes the action
5. User sees your branded verification/reset page
6. Action is completed and user is redirected to dashboard

The custom action URL includes parameters like:
- `mode`: "verifyEmail" or "resetPassword"  
- `oobCode`: The verification/reset code
- `apiKey`: Your Firebase API key

Your EmailActionHandler component automatically processes these parameters and provides a smooth user experience.
